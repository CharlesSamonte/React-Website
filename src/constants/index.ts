He took on the project with real passion, and it absolutely shows in the quality of his craftsmanship. On top of the welding, William also spotted an issue with our wheels that we hadn’t noticed. Thanks to him, our food truck is now running smoothly and ready to roll just in time for summer. If you’re looking for someone who genuinely cares about their work and their customers, Autocradle is the one to call.`,
